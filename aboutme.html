      <h1>My name is Jacqueline Duong!</h1>
    <p>I was born on September 1, 2000 in Fountain Valley Hospital. All of my childhood took place in Orange County,</p>
    <p>until I moved to Riverside for 5th grade. I listen to kpop, with my favorite group being exo, and going to a kpop</p>
    <p>concert being on my bucketlist. </p>
